# GameGram

GameGram is a social network for gamers that allows you to publish posts, write comments, add likes... This social network is developed in PHP from scratch with an home made framework and a custom ORM. This project allows you to understand how a more elaborate framework works by recreating all the modules by hand (routing, ORM, query builder, templating, etc.)
